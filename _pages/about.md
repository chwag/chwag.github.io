Our group focuses on computational systems analyses of biological processes. We use mechanistic computational models to integrate heterogenous data into predictive models. We have a particular interest in mechanisms that promote the emergence and spread of antimicrobial resistance, which we study at the cellular and population level as well as across patients. <br> <br>
We are an interdisciplinary group led by Andrea Weisse. Our expertise ranges from biology and biochemistry to bioinformatics, mathematics and machine learning. This is why are lucky to be located at both the School of Biological Sciences and the School of Informatics, and also to be members of the Centre for Engineering Biology. <br> <br>
