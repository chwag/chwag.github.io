  Our group focuses on computational systems analyses of biological processes. We use mechanistic computational models 
to integrate heterogenous data into predictive models. We have a particular interest in mechanisms that promote the 
emergence and spread of antimicrobial resistance, which we study at the cellular and population level as well as across 
patients. <br> <br>
  We are an interdisciplinary group led by <a href="/people/andreaWeisse/">Andrea Wei√üe</a>. Our expertise ranges from 
biology and biochemistry to bioinformatics, mathematics and machine learning. This is why we are lucky to be located at 
both the <a href="https://www.ed.ac.uk/biology">School of Biological Sciences</a> and the <a 
href="https://www.ed.ac.uk/informatics/">School of Informatics</a>, and also to be members of the <a 
href="https://www.ed.ac.uk/biology/centre-engineering-biology">Centre for Engineering Biology</a>. <br> <br>
