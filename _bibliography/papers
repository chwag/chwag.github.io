    abstract = "We present an improved adaptive approach for studying systems of ODEs affected by parameter variability and state space uncertainty. Our approach is based on a reformulation of the ODE problem as a transport problem of a probability density describing the evolution of the ensemble of systems in time. The resulting multidimensional problem is solved by representing the probability density w.r.t. an adaptively chosen Galerkin ansatz space of Gaussian densities. Due to our improvements in adaptivity control, we substantially improved the overall performance of the original algorithm and moreover inherited to the numerical scheme the theoretical property that the number of Gaussian distributions remains constant for linear ODEs. We illustrate the approach in application to dynamical systems describing the pharmacokinetics of drugs and xenobiotics, where variability in physiological parameters is important to be considered.",

    abstract = "Significance Cells have finite resources. Committing resources to one task therefore reduces the amount of resources available to others. These trade-offs are often overlooked but potentially modify all cellular processes. Building a mathematical cell model that respects such trade-offs and describes the mechanisms of protein synthesis and how cells extract resources from their environment, we quantitatively recover the typical behavior of an individual growing cell and of a population of cells. As trade-offs are experienced by all cells and because growth largely determines cellular fitness, a predictive understanding of how biochemical processes affect others and affect growth is important for diverse applications, such as the use of microbes for biotechnology, the inhibition of antibiotic resistance, and the growth of cancers. , Intracellular processes rarely work in isolation but continually interact with the rest of the cell. In microbes, for example, we now know that gene expression across the whole genome typically changes with growth rate. The mechanisms driving such global regulation, however, are not well understood. Here we consider three trade-offs that, because of limitations in levels of cellular energy, free ribosomes, and proteins, are faced by all living cells and we construct a mechanistic model that comprises these trade-offs. Our model couples gene expression with growth rate and growth rate with a growing population of cells. We show that the model recovers Monod’s law for the growth of microbes and two other empirical relationships connecting growth rate to the mass fraction of ribosomes. Further, we can explain growth-related effects in dosage compensation by paralogs and predict host–circuit interactions in synthetic biology. Simulating competitions between strains, we find that the regulation of metabolic pathways may have evolved not to match expression of enzymes to levels of extracellular substrates in changing environments but rather to balance a trade-off between exploiting one type of nutrient over another. Although coarse-grained, the trade-offs that the model embodies are fundamental, and, as such, our modeling framework has potentially wide application, including in both biotechnology and medicine.",
