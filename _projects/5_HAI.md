Using network analysis, we investigate transmission dynamics of HAIs among hospital patients. Our goal is to pinpoint outbreak clusters, elucidate transmission routes, and derive insights to guide effective infection control strategies. We focus on the transmission of multi-drug resistant bacteria, which complements our foundational research into factors driving the emergence and spread of antibiotic resistance.
