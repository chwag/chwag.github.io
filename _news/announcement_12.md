Happy new year and with the new year come new changes. We say goodbye (for now) to Peter and welcome Huy for his PhD rotation with the group. <a href="/people/malachyMcEvoy/">Malachy</a> is joining for his honours projects on optimisation of cell-free protein synthesis. Equally, <a href="/people/tristanFarmer/">Tristan</a> is joining for his honours project on a stochastic bacterial growth model. Lastly, we congratulate Rohan for making his next step and taking up a position in Basel at Novartis after finishing his PhD!
