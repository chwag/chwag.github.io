Happy new year and with the new year come new changes. We say goodbye (for now) to Peter and welcome Huy for his PhD rotation with the group. Malachy is joining for his honours projects on optimisation of cell-free protein synthesis. Equally, Tristan is joining for his honours project on a stochastic bacterial growth model. Lastly, we congratulate Rohan for making his next step and taking up a position in Basel at Novartis after finishing his PhD!
