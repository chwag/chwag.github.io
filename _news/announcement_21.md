There are some conference-filled weeks behind us. While Christoph presented his work at the Engineering & Safeguarding 
Synthetic Life conference in Manchester, Hollie and Andrea travelled to Jena for some excellent discussion on 
antimicrobial resistance. Finally, Hollie, Rodrigo, Christoph and Andrea all spent a week in sunny Aussois at the 
CompSysBio workshop.
