      I joined the group this year to complete my Biotechnology honours project. I’m particularly interested in the 
intersection of biology, modelling and machine learning, and will be working mostly with Hollie and Christoph during my 
final year as an undergrad. I’m hoping to go on to study computational and synthetic biology for my masters degree.

Outside of my studies, I am the head of biology for the Edinburgh Student Research Association. I love playing piano 
and saxophone, and  perform regularly at the Jazz Bar and the Doghouse.
