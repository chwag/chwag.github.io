        I am currently a Chancellor's Fellow in Biomedical Computation, jointly appointed by the School of Biological Sciences (Institute of Quantitative Biology, Biochemistry and Biotechnology) and the School of Informatics (Institute for Adaptive and Neural Computation). <br> <br>
        Originally, I am from Berlin, Germany, where I studied Computational Biology at the Freie Universität Berlin and obtained a PhD in Scientific Computing, also from the FU Berlin and as part of the International Max Planck Research School at the MPI for Molecular Genetics. During my PhD, I also spent considerable time visiting the Hamilton Institute in Ireland. <br> <br>
        I held postdoctoral positions at the University of Edinburgh (with Peter Swain and Vincent Danos) and Imperial College London (with Alison Holmes, OBE). <br> <br>
