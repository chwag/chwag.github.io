      I am currently a Chancellor's Fellow in Biomedical Computation, jointly appointed by the <a href="https://www.ed.ac.uk/biology">School of Biological Sciences</a> in the <a href="https://www.ed.ac.uk/biology/quantitative-biology-biochemistry-biotechnology">Institute of Quantitative Biology, Biochemistry and Biotechnology</a> and the <a href="https://www.ed.ac.uk/informatics/"> School of Informatics</a> in the <a href="https://web.inf.ed.ac.uk/anc">Institute for Adaptive and Neural Computation</a>. <br> <br>
      Originally, I am from Berlin, Germany, where I studied Computational Biology at the <a href="https://www.fu-berlin.de/">Freie Universität Berlin</a> and obtained a PhD in Scientific Computing, also from the FU Berlin and as part of the <a href="https://www.molgen.mpg.de/IMPRS">International Max Planck Research School</a> at the <a href="https://www.molgen.mpg.de/2168/en">MPI for Molecular Genetics</a>. During my PhD, I also spent considerable time visiting the <a href="https://www.maynoothuniversity.ie/hamilton">Hamilton Institute</a> in Ireland. <br> <br>
      I held postdoctoral positions at the University of Edinburgh (with <a href="https://swainlab.bio.ed.ac.uk/index.html">Peter Swain</a> and <a href="https://www.research.ed.ac.uk/en/persons/vincent-danos">Vincent Danos</a>) and Imperial College London (with <a href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/alison.holmes">Alison Holmes</a>, OBE). <br> <br>
