      I am currently in my first year of the <a href="https://www.ai4biomed.io/">CDT in AI for Biomedical Innovation</a> 
at the School of Informatics. My research focuses on Robust Bayesian Experimental Design to better understand 
Antibacterial Resistance. Before shifting my focus to using statistics and AI in biomedical computation, I was 
dedicated to applying these disciplines to socioeconomic and environmental topics within international development 
organisations and governments. <br> <br>
I hold an MSc in Statistics with Data Science from the University of Edinburgh. Additionally, through a dual-degree 
programme, I completed two integrated master’s degrees: one in Mathematical Engineering at Universidad de Chile, and 
another in General Engineering at École Centrale Paris. <br> <br>
Outside my professional life, I spend most of my time running and racing on hills and mountains. I also love hiking 
trips and enjoy being part of the multicultural community in Edinburgh.
