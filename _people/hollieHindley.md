        I joined the group in 2021 when I started my PhD in mathematical modelling of RNA repair. I’ve always had an 
interest in antimicrobial resistance and have completed projects in my BSc and MSc on antibiotic resistance at the 
University of Bristol where I studied biochemistry. My PhD also has an AMR focus through modelling of a gene system in 
bacteria, which is implicated in antibiotic tolerance. This system is highly conserved across all domains of life, 
highlighting its importance and our interest in discovering more about why it causes tolerance and how we can 
potentiate antibiotic treatments in the future. <br> <br>
        Outside of my PhD I am a competitive triathlete and I love exploring the amazing outdoors we have on our 
doorstep in Edinburgh!
