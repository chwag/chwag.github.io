      I started my PhD in August 2021 in Prof. Huisingaâ€™s research group at the University of Potsdam. Since the 
inception of the project, Andrea has been my external supervisor. My PhD project is part of the graduate research 
training program PharMetrX, an interdisciplinary initiative that aims to train junior scientists in the field of 
pharmacometrics and computational disease modelling. <br> <br>
      Prior to joining PharMetrX, I obtained a Bachelor of Science in Biomedical Sciences from the Autonomous 
University of Barcelona, and a Master of Science in the same field from the Leiden University Medical Centre, where I 
specialized in immunology and infectious diseases. Throughout my academic journey, I have developed a keen interest in 
mathematical modelling of biological systems, as I believe it has tremendous potential to contextualize observed 
biological data. In my PhD project I focus on the development of a model for bacterial responses to antibiotics, with 
the goal of creating a tool to support the design of antibiotic combination therapies.
